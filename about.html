    <h2>About Smart Pillbox 💊</h2>
    <p>
      The Smart Pillbox is a digital health assistant designed to help people,
      especially senior citizens, take their medicines on time without any confusion.
      Our goal is to make healthcare easier, more reliable, and stress-free.

    <p>
      This website allows users to set reminders, view their medicine schedules,
      and get gentle alerts for timely intake. It was developed as a Community
      Engagement Project by students of <strong>SE E&TC PCCOER</strong>.

    <p>
      We believe technology can care — through simplicity, clarity, and compassion. 💚
